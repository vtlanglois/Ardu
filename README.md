# Arduino Kid Controller - I341
This repo contains the code used for an Arduino controller designed for children to use.

This project was created as part of a class project in INFO-I341, an Informatics course offered by Indiana University during the Spring 2023 semester.

# Setup
## Arduino UNO
1. Compile and upload `controller.ino` onto your Arduino UNO
2. After upload, unplug your Arduino from your computer and plug it back in
   - This ensures that the UNO is **not** communicating with the serial port
3. Run `consumer.py` while your UNO is plugged into your computer

## Pro Micro
1. Compile and upload `pro-micro-controller` onto your Pro Micro
